# IP_Addresses

Script was created for Python3.9 version.
To run the script just download the 'main.py' file. Place it on the server and run using the "python3" command. Example:
"python3 main.py 1.1.1.1 4.4.4.4"

Script needs two arguments - first and second IPv4 address. Script validates those IP addresses and returns the number between those 2 IP addresses
